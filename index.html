  <h2> Discover the island </h2>
  
  <p class="content"> East of Madagscar and south of Seychelles, you already imagine how this island would be. Mauritius is of volcanic origins and thus its reliefs shows how this country has been formed, some 6 million years ago.  Hopefully all the volcanoes are now dormant. Thus, you can have a look at all these volcanoes in the south of the island where the nature and forests are still intact. On the west, it is very dry and warm. In the north, part it is also warm and there are most of the sandy beaches, with the existence of solid coral reefs and so the main hotels have been built here.</p>

 <h2> Best time to visit us </h2> 
 <p class="content"> Now, when to come? As we are in the north of Mauritius, a warm climate awaits you the whole year (with few rainy days), except in August when the minimum temperature at night can only fall to 19 degrees ! So, our extreme winter is a bit like Europe's spring. This means that you can travel here at any period of the year, but beware however of the tropical cyclones that can come anytime during the summer period, from December to February. </p>
