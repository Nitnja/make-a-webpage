# make-a-webpage
Project for Stage 2 of IPND
This repo contains the code required to launch the html file in a browser, in order to complete my project specifications for Stage 2 - "Making a Web Page" of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree.
There is a main page generated with the html file, index.html, which also links to the other file placesvisit.html
Both these html files make use of styling from the style.css file.
